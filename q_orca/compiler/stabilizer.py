"""Clifford classification for the stabilizer fast-path backend.

`is_clifford(machine)` walks every gate a machine can apply — bare-action
gates and per-call-site expansions of parametric actions, the same walk the
static unitarity check uses — and reports whether the whole circuit is
Clifford-only. A Clifford circuit can be verified on a stabilizer tableau in
polynomial time instead of the `O(2^n)` state-vector path.

The Clifford gate set is `{H, S, Sdg, X, Y, Z, CNOT/CX, CY, CZ, SWAP}` plus
`Rx/Ry/Rz` at angles that are integer multiples of `pi/2`. Gate-name
membership is cross-checked against the canonical `KNOWN_UNITARY_GATES` so a
newly added gate is treated as non-Clifford until it is explicitly classified
here.
